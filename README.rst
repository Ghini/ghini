ghini - reloaded
============================

**ghini - reloaded** is the new Ghini family picture.

the central ghini.server is there for all other Ghini family members.  it
serves data from one garden, or for several.

* in combination with the ghini.gardener web client, it lets garden
  conservators plan their work, produce logs, and review their garden
  history.
* in combination with the ghini.visitor web client, it provides a read-only
  access to the complete database.
* in combination with ghini.pocket, it lets gardeners streamline their daily
  activities, and make it visible to the garden conservator.
* in combination with ghini.tour, it lets visitors find their way in the
  garden.
* it can also cooperate with other instances of ghini.server, and
  contribute selected data to a ghini aggregator instance.  the same
  ghini.visitor web client will now show data from several gardens at the
  same time.
